### TODO:
- scrolling chat history; (somewhat works out of box); +
- log errors to file; +
- give serial id to each msg in chat to track it; (use slice index) +
- show msg id next to the msg; +
- regen last message; +
- delete last message; +
- edit message? (including from bot); +
- ability to copy message;
- aility to copy selected text; (I can do it though vim mode of the terminal, so +)
- menu with old chats (chat files); +
- fullscreen textarea option (for long prompt);
- tab to switch selection between textview and textarea (input and chat); +
- basic tools: memorize and recall;
- stop stream from the bot; +
- sqlitedb instead of chatfiles; +
- sqlite for the bot memory;

### FIX:
- bot responding (or haninging) blocks everything; +
- programm requires history folder, but it is .gitignore; +
